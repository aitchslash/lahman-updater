ToDo:
*** Reset_master is commented out for testing (inserting rookies takes forever) ***

add --verbose, dbpath flags 

for verbose this looked cool:

make inserts for teams, playoffs, all-star etc.

ensure that duplicate names (e.g. Chris Carpenter 2011) are taken care of
:   put an assertion in get_ids - should deal w/ it better
:	could nest id's like stints
:	could rework w/ bbref as key (not as value)

look into context managers vs. pymysql - might use to supress spynner's AttributeError

move testers and resets to utils

update readme

extra code in rookie_deets from when it updated

examine batting stats on bbref to maybe get more
:   consider getting WAR - player value
:	BAbip, OPS, SLG, OPS+ - advanced batting
: 	line drive % - ratios
:	can't find vs R, vs L

remove global for chadwick
consider grabbing chadwick from the git repo.
:  might be able to get date as well (prevent unneeded d/l's)

think about how to deal w/ birthState hack to 2 chars
