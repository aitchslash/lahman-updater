ToDo:
*** Reset_master is commented out for testing (inserting rookies takes forever) ***

-x flag worked when it shouldn't have. - need a check "RUN insert here"
:	may need a check that year is prior to current season and/or data doesn't exist

--addstats take a year go back and update with expanded stats (for year in past_years)

requirements - spynner, pymysql

make inserts for teams, playoffs, all-star etc.

ensure that duplicate names (e.g. Chris Carpenter 2011) are taken care of
:   put an assertion in get_ids - should deal w/ it better
:	could nest id's like stints
:	could rework w/ bbref as key (not as value)

move testers and resets to utils

extra code in rookie_deets from when it updated

examine batting stats on bbref to maybe get more
:   consider getting WAR - player value
:	BAbip, OPS, SLG, OPS+ - advanced batting
: 	line drive % - ratios
: 	wOBA - ????
:	can't find vs R, vs L -????

think about how to deal w/ birthState hack to 2 chars
