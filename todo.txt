ToDo:
*** Reset_master is commented out for testing (inserting rookies takes forever) ***

test cmd line argparse

test past years - may have issues w/ bbref formats (in season vs. archived)
:   need to write an update for expanded stats
:   non-current years, write an update - would be excellent to write a data checker here.

ensure that duplicate names (e.g. Alex Gonsalez) are taken care of
:   put an assertion in get_ids - should deal w/ it better

look into context managers vs. pymysql - might use to supress spynner's AttributeError

        looking-for-a-more-pythonic-way-to-access-the-database

move testers and resets to utils

might want to break into a setup.py and a update.py

delete old code and print statements
improve comments and doc strings
update readme

extra code in rookie_deets from when it updated

examine batting stats on bbref to maybe get more
:   consider getting WAR

remove global for chadwick
consider grabbing chadwick from the git repo.
:  might be able to get date as well (prevent unneeded d/l's)

think about how to deal w/ birthState hack to 2 chars
mexican states.zip is available http://www.baseball-databank.org/files/tables/

finalGame in master not updating.

open lahman15 release
:   check inf(inity extracted) pitching
:   check teamID's for Chicago
